                            Even the strongest men in his situation would begin to conform to norms. Yet, he is not the man who will succumb to circumstances. Many times over the last 10 years he has hit rock bottom. Every penny he makes, he invested in his software whims to do good in this society.
                            He continued to compensate his teams, over and above his own survival, to at times sleep
                            with no roof, cash, food and phone. Even his family lost all of it a long time ago when he
                            was barely 20. He was pressed by his family and well wishers to take up a job, for he was
                            receiving lucrative job offers by the day. He was criticised by those who ones loved him. A
                            person in his situation should have not survived. In this period of struggle, no one came
                            to his aid. He kept his head held high, didn’t take up a job and still sails forward like a
                            warrior on his mission to free the world from present structures, boundaries and meanings.
                            This journey is leading him into a true story of rarest courage and conviction, as it
                            unfolds before the world, in more action than words, over a long period of time.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="text_cursive">
                            If we had to describe Nishchal Kesarwani in one line to you, it would be impossible.
                            However, here is our failed attempt - He is the founder and a boundless leader at <strong><a
                                    href="http://www.chattodo.co/" target="_blank">Chattodo</a> </strong> and <strong><a
                                    href="http://preseed.in/" target="_blank">Preseed</a></strong>.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            He lives in the world of extraordinary ideas, idealism, inspiration, simplicity, a bicycle,
                            a backpack, some yoga and lots of action. He questions, inspires and teaches us to be who
                            we are becoming on this journey together. He does this in his well informed, imaginative,
                            idealistic, bold and democratic style of leadership, unique only to him.<br>
                            <strong>He is Preseed’s first resident Yoga exponent and researcher</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He is in his early 30s, and has a way to express his theory of no god or the origin of the universe, its end and what after the end, without using religion and mysticism. We have never known anyone who can express such complex ideas with such ease, passion and simplicity. When one asks him, how do you know all this and how do you dabble between spirituality and the material world of technology. He says, <strong>"Firsly, none of what I know is my own. It is all just flowing through me. The reason for that is resonation. I am at the same frequency as the fundamental truth itself".</strong> And then he goes on to explain how energy flows into each other and how shapes and forms take place. So, one of his favourite quotes is -
				
		<br>
                        <blockquote class="text_cursive quote_part">&quot;I think the trouble with being a critical thinker or an atheist, or a humanist is that you’re right. And it’s quite hard being right in the face of people who are wrong without sounding like a fuckwit. People go ‘Do you think the vast majority of the world is wrong?’ Well, yes. I don’t know how to say that nicely, but yes.&quot; - TIM MINCHIN</blockquote>
				
				
				
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He is unabashed in praising you as he is unabashed in praising himself. He says, "Why should I draw a line in the way I talk about you when in praise, and the way I talk about me, when in self praise. Why should I treat you and I differently if are both worthy. I like honesty far above and beyond humility". Yet he is humble. We love that. He may say not everyone is an equal, and then go on to prove it through frequencies of atoms rendering different shapes and forms. He is an extraordinary person.
                            </p>

                            Nishchal has been an entrepreneur of 10 plus years. He has lectured in business along side the likes of Ritesh Agarwal, founder of <a href="https://www.oyorooms.com/" target="_blank">OYORooms.com</a>. He has also received director/co-founder level offers from founders of <a href="https://www.91springboard.com/" target="_blank">91springboard</a> and <a href="http://www.embibe.com/" target="_blank">Embibe</a> to join them in their own companies. You may notice Nishchal has knowledge beyond his years. You may read more about him from the social links above. We highly recommend you read about him as much as you can (in the order of social links mentioned above). He will change your life. For the topic he dwelled in most about in his life, is life itself. We bet he has done a fantastic job at it.
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            His life's purpose may be summed up as following :-
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            1. <strong>Karma</strong> - His purpose is to work in the area of liberating people through
                            technology entrepreneurship of the righteous intent, so that at least some of them could
                            truly and soulfully do that what is meaningful to their soul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. <strong>Dharma</strong> - He walks the path of karma also to help (wo)mankind make
                            progress through their own actions towards liberating them from their non scientific and
                            rigid beliefs of life and universe, so that they could do what they find harmony in. Hence,
                            his purpose is also to ensure that the soul is not ignored any more. His purpose is to
                            understand and impart the awareness of the god's vibe through yoga. </p>
                        <p>
                            3. <strong>Seva</strong> - His purpose is to ensure that each life he touches on this
                            journey to building products gets truly served in their righteous progress. This is how he
                            perceives the value of his products, not through the value of money.</p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            The things he do in a day, enable him to stumble upon many teams with good ideas and a
                            strong will to build further upon their ideas, through their skills, perhaps even a sound
                            prototype, logistical and back end capabilities. Almost invariably, if he finds them good
                            enough to ping his mind, he would have views for them that could help them make further
                            progress. But these views are not mere theoretical views, these are strategies that need to
                            be executed beyond the current capabilities of the prototype team. So, in order to help
                            these teams at different stages of the startup life cycle we have allowed for such teams to
                            engage with Nishchal directly. Although, this will be useful when startup teams are willing
                            to stay focused on the strategy proposed by Nishchal, above all else.</p>

                            important company. He leads it from the front. Everything else he does, is how he handles
                            the requests of other startups or clients with that 20% of his time left in a day, very
                            effectively with this cultural system, called <strong>Preseed</strong>. Chattodo is a
                            product of which, Preseed is a cultural manifestation. They both run the same blood and

			<br>
			Nishchal is not a conventionally educated man. He dropped out of college. However, he is an extremely learned and observant man, but most importantly, he is a meditative man. He learned his early entrepreneurial lessons by leading a team of extraordinary men and women while he was only 23. To know who were the people he led in his first company FloEco India Pvt. Ltd., and what they went on to become, click on their names to know these global stars —  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paragarora" target="_blank">Parag Arora(YC)</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidkhattri" target="_blank">Siddharth Khattri</a>(Google & Techstars), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-kesarwani-2b485013" target="_blank">Neha Kesarwani</a> (cofounder www.vertoe.com), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabeer-jain-8366557" target="_blank">Kabeer Jain</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-yadav-86390aaa" target="_blank">Siddharth Yadav</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinayrks" target="_blank">Vinay Yadav</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/puneetbharti" target="_blank">Puneet Bharti</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xagupta" target="_blank">Akshay Gupta</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafa-shahanshah-58772310" target="_blank">Mustafa Shahansha</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafa-shahanshah-58772310" target="_blank">Puneet Bharti</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunrajput" target="_blank">Varun Rajput</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atulagrwal" target="_blank">Atul Agarwal</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radskapoor" target="_blank">Radhika Kapoor</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatin-agarwal-20295313" target="_blank">Jatin Agarwal</a>. This was his first team, and he was their first captain. He has a knack for identifying talent before it reaches the rest of the world. It may have been painful to have lost that team, and starting from scratch, from that rock bottom. This situation must have had something to do with Nishchal's new found raised bar at Preseed. 
            <br></br>
            Somewhere along the way, Nishchal got offers from companies like <a href="http://www.91springboard.com/" target="_blank">91 Springboard</a> and <a href="http://www.embibe.com/" target="_blank">Embibe</a>, by their charismatic founders to join them as a co-founder and director. He had to politely turned those offers down by those game-changing men and women. Nishchal was to be on a mission of his own. Something only he may be destined to do. Today those businesses are at over 200 million dollars in valuation, while Nishchal is building a Chinese bamboo. It is deeper below the ground than above it.

			To say the least, his constant advice will help you understand your business ahead from some new standpoints, perhaps, over a noticeable period of time. He will prepare you for your investment/incubation readiness. The slide deck you will make together will help you raise investment. However, that is the least of the reasons he will help you in the making of a right Slide Deck. What is the most important reason he will do this exercise for? This is the process with which he will reveal your company to you with some new standpoints. His questions to you, and your understanding thereafter can make all the difference.

			Over the years his $100,000 backed startup failure with the above-mentioned star-studded team in 2010 at his ripe age of 25, to starting Preseed as a community in 2012, up to now, Jan 2014, he often finds himself and his team  advising a lot of business owners and friends, who have come to us seeking his advice on new ways to do business in the new, ever changing age of free information and free tools.
			<br>

        However, he has been so caught up until now in building from the ground up, upon his own ideas listed at <a href="http://preseeded.presed.in/" target="_blank">Preseeded</a> and that he never formally got the time to start our consulting for such businesses and startup friends out there, even though in his personal capacity, <b>in the past</b>, he <b>has advised and executed for companies like —</b>
       <br></br>
       1. <a href="http://www.libramattres.com/" target="_blank">Libra Mattresses</a> (among the top 5 mattress manufacturers in India) - Nishchal aided them in 2009–10 in improving their brand and design. They give his team's designs the credit for making one of their foam product their best seller.
	   <br></br>
       2. <a href="http://www.indiamart.com/jeetindialtd/" target="_blank">Jeet India Limited</a> (a SME in food and beverage) — In 2009–10 Nishchal with his team (that later placed in organizations like google and O&M) worked on their brand, their packaging, their ERP, their IT infrastructure etc.
	   <br></br>
       3. <a href="http://www.investcare.in/" target="_blank">Invest Care</a> — In early 2011 Nishchal and his team deployed IT infrastructure solutions for them through his other co-founded startup called BizOnTech. (Note-: He dropped out of BizOnTech soon after to split from that team, to focus on something more inspiring, that now is called <a href="http://www.preseed.in/" target="_blank">Preseed</a>). 
       <br></br>
	   4. <a href="http://www.omsaiglobal.com/" target="_blank">Om Sai Global</a> — In the mean while to make ends meet Nishchal started advising Om Sai Global on harnessing the internet better and graduated to training their teams. Soon after he became the CEO there for a brief period of 3 months as that allowed him more authority to attempt some overhauling in their company. He did not continue thereafter for he was not motivated to serve real estate business.
       <br></br>
       5. Many more such business consulting stints happened till 2011 December, when he finally decided to not work as a consultant to SMEs anymore, to focus back on what mattered to him the most. What mattered to him the most was building <a href="http://preseeded.presed.in/" target="_blank">Preseeded</a>, which of course in those days around the mid of 2011 was just a thought in his mind, without a form. For Preseeded, <a href="http://www.preseed.in/" target="_blank">Preseed</a> had to happen first. <b>So he started building Preseed.</b>
	   <br></br>
       His main interest of work always lied in building startups from bottom-up, for that leaves more room for some soulful innovation. He liked to innovate on even the way businesses are managed, let alone the product the business is building. His appetite for technology and good design transcends by far  the appetite for technology and good designs in most businesses in India. (Although, ironically, in spite of having the skills and sensibilities, he is unable to devote time to improve designs on his own website :p). 
       <br></br>
       His biggest challenge in consulting SMEs was that they often lacked the creative work force needed to execute what my advise may have contained for them. Hence, it was a fair decision by all regard to stop advising others to focus back on starting up a business that fulfilled his desire to co-build important things that mattered. So, <b>if you are building something important, that leads people to experience greater freedom in his perspective, count him in.<b></br>

3. To then, create a culture of education upon communication and collaboration upon ones own ideas, using a field of artificial intelligence in the near future, NLP. ( $500 billion opportunity to create a new education landscape). Here education will happen just by chance.<br>
4. To then give preventive healthcare by measuring 5 elements in your body — earth, air, water, fire and ether.<br>
5. To then give you freedom from archaic education and healthcare systems.<br><br>

                             <strong>Only action over written words first. Just the way I have written in this essay plenty about <br>I and what am I here to do for you, I expect you to do the same.</strong><br><br>


We don’t do physical meetings unless:<br></br>
1. There is a signed detailed letter of intent by you indicating clearly all of what you seek from us. It can simply be an email to us from your highest relevant authority.<br></br>
2. A written acknowledgment that you have gone through our essays on Medium, linked to our services listed on our home page www.preseed.in.<br></br>
3. You have made efforts through communication with us on Whatsapp chats, voice notes, video calls, and emails to minimize ambiguity towards clarity of our relationship.<br></br>
4. You have then proceeded to talk to us over phone calls.<br></br>
5. You may come to the place of our being. Our office is in New Delhi and Lucknow. However, we mostly work from remote locations like the mountains or sometimes, the beaches. You may check with us about our current whereabouts, and come to meet us there instead.<br></br>

If most of the above is done, and now there is a genuine need of a physical meeting at your place of being, after having used web technology for meetings and video conferencing, you may proceed to transfer the amount equal to the cost of a to and fro air ticket for us and a reasonable stay in your city, no less than Rs. 25,000 in total in our bank account, per person visiting you, from our side:<br></br>

For bank account info reach <a href="mailto:sushmita.preseed@gmail.com">sushmita.preseed@gmail.com</a>
<br></br>
Once done, you may intimate us on our email with all of the above and we will proceed to book our tickets to you shortly.<br></br>

There’s nothing more annoying than meeting just to meet. Business meetings aren’t effective when a decision needs to be made or for informational purposes. You can take care of that with a simple phone call or a company-wide email with a plea for no reply.<br></br>

Unless it’s a brainstorming session, a meeting should be called only to support and convey a previously made decision. A productive business meeting produces a committed plan of action. To stay on track, curb any irrelevant discussions, interruptions, and repeated points.<br>
<br>
<b>Begin the meeting before it starts.</b><br><br>
“Prepare people ahead of time so you are all on the same page when you enter the room,” Wrike founder Andrew Filev advises. “Create notes and an agenda in advance and — here’s the tricky part — actually review them before the meeting starts.”<br><br>

He also recommends putting key information someplace where participants can see it and discuss it in a running thread well before the actual meeting. “That way, the meeting is focused on solving problems and not just describing them,” he says. “The first 10 minutes of your meeting shouldn’t be a discussion of why you’re meeting.”<br><br>

This essay is just our attempt to ensure the meeting or series of meetings during our physical presence with you are fruitful.<br></br>

<b>Note -:</b> We detest the idea of meetings when there are more than 5 participants and ambiguous reasons for the presence of 5. We don’t however mind numerous silent observers.
<br><br>
If you have any doubt about our understandings of efficient meetings, google “meetings are inefficient” or “meetings kill productivity” etc. Having said that, we don’t mean that this is always true. However, it is mostly always true when the agenda of the meeting is not clear with a defined boundary unless the agenda itself is — boundless brainstorming.
